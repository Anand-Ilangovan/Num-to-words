# 🔢 Num-to-Words Converter (Custom `num2words` Clone)

A Python-based program that converts numbers (including decimals) into their word equivalents using Indian numbering system — with support for Lakhs, Crores, and more!

## 🎯 Features

- Convert integers and decimals to words  
- Supports negative numbers  
- Uses Indian format (Thousands, Lakhs, Crores)  
- Command-line interface

## 🧠 How It Works

This script defines a `NumberToWords` class that:
- Breaks down the number by digit ranges (hundreds, thousands, etc.)
- Converts each range using lists of words
- Handles decimals and negative values

## 📦 Requirements

This project uses **only built-in Python libraries**, so no installation needed.

## 🚀 Usage

Run the script in terminal:

```bash
python oops.py

Then input numbers like:

100

45984

-78.23

10000000

## 💡 Example

Enter the Number: 12345
Twelve Thousand Three Hundred Forty Five
